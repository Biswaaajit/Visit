# stopOver Web Application

This web app keeps the track of user travels in a world map. I used a fake API to store and fetch data. When a user click on the map a form appears to add to the list of the user travel. 


## Deployment

To start this project open cmd and run

```bash
  npm i
  npm run dev
```
On another cmd  run this code for fake API

```bash
  npm run server
```


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
