# stopOver Web Application

This web application keep track of user travels .I used third parties libraries like React-Router and Leaflet to make this react web application.This application have fully functioning navbar which takes to different components onclicking on it using React-Router.There is also a world map where user's travel places are marked based on initial data that is fetched from fake an API.When user click "start tracking now" button it takes to component where on its leftsidea list is rendered and right-side a map is rendered. When user click on the mapform appears on left-side and on filling the details it get added to the cities list.On clicking on countries tab its also shows the countries user has visited.

## Deployment

```bash
  npm i
  npm run dev
```
On another cmd  run this code for fake API

```bash
  npm run server
```


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
